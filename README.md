### Building a hierarchical contentÂ model

let's establish a hierarchical structure of the application content model that has the following three levels of components:

- page
- template
- component

We'll also be using components like config in order to modify the behavior of the available types and to store general information about the application. The references to files stored in CMS will be added to our components. These files can be considered as an additional hierarchical level of a lower rank.
